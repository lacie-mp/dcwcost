## Content lives in data files

Editable content is centralized in `src/data/` so copy changes don't require
touching page markup:

- `sectors.js` — sector landing pages + market grids
- `projects.js` — project case studies
- `insights.js` — Insights articles

> **⚠️ Verify before launch:** the team roster in `src/pages/about.astro` and
> the testimonials are drawn from public record and need confirmation against
> DCW's own records. (Founding year is confirmed: DCW was founded in 2012 and
> began delivering project work in 2013.) Project case studies in
> `src/data/projects.js` should likewise be confirmed and expanded.

npm install     # install dependencies

```

## Deployment

Netlify builds with `npm run build` and publishes the `dist/` directory

(`data-netlify="true"`).
